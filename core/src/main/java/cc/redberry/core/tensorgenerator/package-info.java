/**
 * Facilities for generating tensor of the most general
 * form with specified free indices from specified tensors.
 * <br>Consider the example:</br>
 * <pre><code>
 *     Tensor[] samples = Tensors.parse("g_mn", "g^mn", "d_m^n");
 *     Tensor t = TensorGenerator.generate("c", ParserIndices.parseSimple("_{mnab}"), false, samples);
 *     System.out.println(t);
 * </code></pre>
 * This code produces
 * <pre><code>
 *  c1*g_mn*g_ab + c2*g_ma*g_nb + c3*g_mb*gna
 * </code></pre>
