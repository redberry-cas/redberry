/**
 * Data structures and algorithms for creating mathematical expressions. Class {@link cc.redberry.core.tensor.Tensor}
 * is parent for all mathematical expressions. Each type of expressions strictly satisfies some standard form, which
 * is defined in the corresponding {@link cc.redberry.core.tensor.TensorFactory} and {@link cc.redberry.core.tensor.TensorBuilder}. Thus, there is no public
 * constructors in Tensor inheritors, and any expression should be created via factory or builder. Simple tensors
 * and fields should be instantiated via corresponding static methods  in {@link cc.redberry.core.tensor.Tensors} class.
