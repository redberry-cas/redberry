/**
 * Implementation of numbers in Redberry. The implementation includes real numbers ({@link cc.redberry.core.number.Real}):
 * big rational ({@link cc.redberry.core.number.Rational}), floating point ({@link cc.redberry.core.number.Numeric}) and complex numbers ({@link cc.redberry.core.number.Complex}) over
 * the reals. The implementation of big rational numbers is based on the Apache Commons Math {@link org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.BigFraction}.
